# Disassembly

The scope of this project is currently the following:

1. Simulate proteolysis 
2. Estimate the weights in the disassembly graph 
3. Use the disassembly graph to compute disassembly (quantified selection in proteolysis)

Later stages include plugging in real data instead of simulating proteolysis.
