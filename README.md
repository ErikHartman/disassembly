# Disassembly

The [idea](/paper/idea.md) (outdated as hell).

# TODO:

## Fixes

1. It seems that over-estimation of disassembly indexes is common.

## Benchmarks

For more realistic benchmarking, should somehow prefer sequences in specific regions of proteins.

1. Estimated disassembly vs. real disassembly
     - Correlation for different proteases and substrates
2. Estimated disassembly for different proteases
    - Specific proteases should have higher disassembly
